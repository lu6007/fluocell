% The mask of the cell was divided into n layers, which are named as the 
% layer 1, layer 2, ..., and layer n from the boundary toward the centroid. 
% The nodes forming the interface between two different layers were computed
% based on the line segment connecting the centroid and the cell boundary. 
% Briefly, this line segment was divided into n equal parts by (n-1) dividing 
% points. The ith dividing point from the cell boundary was hence used as 
% the correponding nodes forming the interface between the layers i and (i+1). 
% Based on these interface lines and the cell boundary, the label matrix was computed. 
% It has the value i in the layer i, and the value 0 outside of the cell.
%  
% Example:
% Load the cell mask and FA label matrix.
% Divide the cell mask into n layers.
% Calculate the FA property in each layer of the cell.
