Fluocell: A Software Package for Analysis and Visualization of Fluorescence Image of Live Cells

Fluocell is a software package for the analysis and visualization of fluorescence images of live cells, with applications in 
migration and cancer invasion. The main package contains a visualization and quantification tool for fluorescence intensity 
and FRET ratio images. Optional modules of diffusion analysis and polarity analysis can be obtained upon request. This package 
is mainly written in MATLAB. It is being developed by a group of researchers in the "Molecular Engineering for Single Cell 
Imaging and Reprogramming" at University of California, San Diego. As developers, we are open for collaboration on using the 
software or developing additional features. If you find this software package of interest or useful for your work, please 
take the time to cite our work and write an email to tell us, since positive feedbacks are important to secure continuous 
support for this software.
