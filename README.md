Fluocell: A Software Package for Analysis and Visualization of Ratiometric Fluorescence Image of Live Cells

Fluocell is a software package for the analysis and visualization of fluorescence images of live cells, with applications in  migration and cancer invasion. The main package contains a visualization and quantification tool for fluorescence intensity and FRET ratio images. Optional modules of diffusion analysis and polarity analysis can be obtained upon request. This package is mainly written in MATLAB. It is being developed by a group of researchers in the "Molecular Engineering for Single Cell 
Imaging and Reprogramming" at University of California, San Diego. As developers, we are open for collaboration on using the 
software or developing additional features. If you find this software package of interest or useful for your work, please 
take the time to cite our work and write an email to tell us, since positive feedbacks are important to secure continuous 
support for this software.

Tested with operation systems: 
  Windows 10, 64 bit
  MacOS 10, 11.1, 64 bit
Requires Java 8.0 - 15.0 or similar versions
Requires MATLAB, tested in MATLAB 2013-2019 

For starters, the Fluocell User's Guide is in the doc/ folder. The installation guide is under the section "Installation and Usage". After installation, please go through the whole "User's Guide" to get familiar with Fluocell (This takes about 4-8 hours). Then you may go ahead and try with your own data.
